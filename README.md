## THIS PROGRAM IS NOT AUTHORIZED BY SAIT, AND I TAKE NO RTESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYONE USING THIS PROGRAM.

#### How to use:

Download the UniversalExecitable.jar, and run it.

It will make a bunch of ICS files. Each one contains in it one class one one day of the week.

So, for example, if I had `CMPP 269` from 7-9PM on Wednesdays, and 7-9PM on Mondays.
The Monday class would be one file, and the Wednesday class would be another file.

This is so if you drop classes, decide not to take them beforehand, etc.. That it is easy to just not import them in the first place.

Once you get the "success" message, open the .ics file on your computer and it should open your calender application.

#### Limitations/TODOs:
* At least an option to use Microsoft Outlook file format. It might work as is, I'm not sure.
* Make the code cleaner. It's so bad right now. My instructor should NOT see this code :/
* Add an option to combine all classes into one file, like `winter_2020.ics`.
* Add ability to save directly to calender instead of having to open the files.
